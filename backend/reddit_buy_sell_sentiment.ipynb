He then started selling his shitty book in the side bar and tried to sell some shitty trading training run by uncertified autists who weren’t even good they just lost money.

From what I remember this sub was slowly getting more and more popular, and he ramped up to wanting to create an esports event for day trading, and was getting a stadium and stuff. He wanted sponsors for the event and one of them was a trading online course/school type thing. He sort of pushed that and the sub hated this idea and also hated the idea of the publicity.
